    <h3>What is version control?</h3>

      <p>Imagine that you have the time, discipline, and inclination to write a detailed personal journal entry every day of your life. Now imagine what it would be like to be able to read through all of those journal entries decades from now; to be able to revisit long-past 'iterations' of yourself and see how you've changed, in detail, over the years.</p>

      <p>Version control is (sort of) like that. Only for software. A version control system archives changes to a set of files over time and makes all of the versions of those files accessible.</p>

    <h3>Benefits of version control</h3>
      <p>There are a lot of good reasons to use version control. Version control allows you to revert your files or your entire project back to a previous state, should you make a catastrophic mistake when you're working on your project. You can also compare changes you and other contributors have made over time and see who and when something was modified that might be causing a problem. The best part is version control systems allow you to do all of this cheaply and efficiently.</p>
