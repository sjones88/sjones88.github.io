 	<p>This week in Phase 0, we took our first dive into JavaScript. After a few days of struggling to get my barings in uncharted waters, I was happy to find that JavaScript and Ruby actually have a lot in common. In this post, I will compare Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects.<span style="font-family:Courier;"></span></p>
  <p>Suppose you want to build a program to keep track of the inventory at a car dealership. You want to use a collection object that allows you to keep track of each car's color, price, model, VIN number, and trim level. In Ruby, your go-to collection object will be a 'hash'; in JavaScript, you'll need an 'object'. Using the literal object syntax in JS, our 'car' object might look something like this:</p>
  <pre style="font-family:Courier;">
    var car = {
      model: '335i',
      color: 'black',
      price: 350000,
      VIN: '123AKEHVIAJ',
      trim: 'sport',
    }
  </pre>
  <p>If you're at all familiar with Ruby, this code should look familiar; if you removed the 'var' and pasted this code into a Ruby file, you'd have a hash. Like hashes, JS objects are collections of name/value pairs, where the names are unique and can be any kind of object. In Ruby, hashes have their own class and several methods, including the .each method. JS objects don't have a method comparable to Ruby's .each iterator.</p>
